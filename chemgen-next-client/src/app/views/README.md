# Views

These are the main layouts of the experiments. They can be used in scoring and in regular viewing.

## Plate View

Shows a layout of the entire plate, without empty wells. Any wells with a reagent in them have a button above them that can opens an ExpSet view.

## Exp Set Album View

This is the preferred Abu Dhabi view, where there is a row of randomly chosen L4440s (Control Strain - temperature sensitive), the next row(s) are the mutant + reagent, the next L4440 + N2, and then the N2 + reagent.

## Exp Set Data

The ExpSet has a set of associated data: reagents, plates in the batch, batch itself (temperature, screen, worm strains) scores.
